# junkcoin-core-wallet
This repository is prepared for the development and maintenance of the Junkcoin Core Wallet.

- **Branches**:
  - `main`: Stable releases (default branch).
  - `dev`: Development and active feature work.

This repository will eventually include the fork of the previous Junkcoin core codebase. For now, it is set up to provide a clean and well-organized foundation for future development.

## Next Steps
- Fork the old Junkcoin repository and merge it here.
- Implement build instructions and contribution guidelines.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.
