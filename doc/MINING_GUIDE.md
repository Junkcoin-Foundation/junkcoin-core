## Introduction

Junkcoin 3.1.1 introduces a new development fund system that requires miners to specify a miner address using the `-mineraddress` parameter. This guide will help you set up and configure your mining operation effectively.

## Development Fund System Overview

The development fund system is designed to:
- Distribute funds to support development and maintenance
- Ensure fair distribution of mining rewards
- Maintain network stability and security

Key features:
- Regular fund distribution intervals
- Validation of miner addresses
- Caching of validated addresses
- Integration with block template creation

### Development Fund Details

1. **Fund Allocation**
   - 20% of block reward goes to development fund
   - 80% of block reward goes to miner

2. **Block Height Range**
   - Starts at: Block 365,000
   - Ends at: Block 3,547,800
   - Active range: 3,182,801 blocks

3. **Fund Distribution**
   - Development fund address is determined by block height
   - Fund is distributed to the development fund address
   - Miner receives remaining 80% of block reward

4. **Development Fund Addresses**
   - Addresses rotate based on block height
   - Rotation interval: (Last Height - Start Height + 1) / Number of Addresses
   - Current addresses:
     - Address 1: [Insert Address 1]
     - Address 2: [Insert Address 2]
     - Address 3: [Insert Address 3]
     - Address 4: [Insert Address 4]

### Mining with Development Fund

1. **Required Parameters**
   - `-mineraddress=<addr>`: Specify the address to use for the miner reward when external miners submit blocks with nonstandard outputs

2. **Mining Process**
   - Block reward is split 20/80 between development fund and miner
   - Miner must specify a valid address using `-mineraddress`
   - Development fund address is automatically determined based on block height

3. **Important Notes**
   - The `-mineraddress` parameter is only effective for blocks within the development fund range
   - The address must be a valid Junkcoin address
   - This parameter is required when development fund is active and wallet is disabled
   - The address is cached for subsequent mining attempts
   - Development fund address changes every [Insert Interval] blocks

## Mining Setup

### Prerequisites
1. A valid Junkcoin address for mining rewards
2. The Junkcoin daemon (junkcoind)
3. Sufficient system resources for mining

### Basic Configuration

1. Start the Junkcoin daemon with your miner address:
```bash
./junkcoind -mineraddress=YOUR_JUNKCOIN_MINER_ADDRESS
```

2. Verify the daemon is running:
```bash
./junkcoin-cli getinfo
```

## Configuration Options

### Required Parameters
- `-mineraddress=<addr>`: Specify the address to use for the miner reward when external miners submit blocks with nonstandard outputs

## Mining Commands

### Check Mining Status
```bash
./junkcoin-cli getmininginfo
```

### Stop Mining
```bash
./junkcoin-cli stop
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Invalid Miner Address**
   - Error: "Invalid miner address: '%s'. Must be a valid Junkcoin address."
   - Solution: Verify your address format and ensure it's a valid Junkcoin address

2. **Keypool Ran Out**
   - Error: "Error: Keypool ran out. Please specify a miner address using -mineraddress."
   - Solution: Specify a valid miner address using the `-mineraddress` parameter

3. **Wallet Disabled**
   - Error: "Junkcoin compiled without wallet and -mineraddress not set. Please specify a valid miner address when development fund is active."
   - Solution: Use the `-mineraddress` parameter when development fund is active

4. **Development Fund Range**
   - Note: The `-mineraddress` parameter is only effective for blocks within the development fund range
   - Solution: Ensure your mining attempts are within the development fund block range

## Best Practices

1. **Security**
   - Keep your mining address secure
   - Use strong passwords for your Junkcoin installation
   - Regularly backup your wallet

2. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor your mining performance regularly
   - Check development fund distribution
   - Verify block reward allocation

3. **Maintenance**
   - Keep your Junkcoin daemon updated
   - Follow network guidelines for optimal mining efficiency
   - Monitor system resources during mining operations

## Security Recommendations

1. **Address Security**
   - Keep your mining address secure
   - Use strong passwords
   - Regularly backup your wallet

2. **System Security**
   - Keep your system updated
   - Use antivirus software
   - Monitor system resources

3. **Network Security**
   - Use secure connections
   - Monitor network activity
   - Report any suspicious activity

## Important Notes

1. **Development Fund System**
   - 20% of block reward goes to development fund
   - 80% of block reward goes to miner
   - Fund distribution is automatic
   - Miner must specify a valid address
   - Development fund addresses rotate every [Insert Interval] blocks

2. **Mining Requirements**
   - Valid Junkcoin address required
   - `-mineraddress` parameter is mandatory
   - Address must be specified for development fund blocks
   - Mining is only active between blocks 365,000 and 3,547,800

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Keep addresses secure
   - Monitor fund distribution
   - Report any issues

This guide provides an overview of the mining system in Junkcoin 3.1.1, with a focus on the development fund feature. Users are encouraged to test thoroughly and report any issues or suggestions for improvement.
