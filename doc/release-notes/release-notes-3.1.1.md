## Mining Guide

### Development Fund System Overview
The development fund system requires miners to specify a miner address using the `-mineraddress` parameter. This address will receive the mining reward when external miners submit blocks with nonstandard outputs.

### Getting Started
1. Ensure you have a valid Junkcoin address for mining rewards
2. Start the Junkcoin daemon with the `-mineraddress` parameter

#### Example Command
```bash
./junkcoind -mineraddress=YOUR_JUNKCOIN_MINER_ADDRESS
```

### Important Notes
- The `-mineraddress` parameter is only effective for blocks within the development fund range
- The address must be a valid Junkcoin address
- This parameter is required when development fund is active and wallet is disabled
- The address is cached and reused for subsequent mining attempts

### Troubleshooting
- If you receive an "Invalid miner address" error, verify that your address is a valid Junkcoin address
- If you receive a "Keypool ran out" error, ensure you have specified a miner address using `-mineraddress`
- If you receive a "Wallet disabled" error, specify a valid miner address when development fund is active
